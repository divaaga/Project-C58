        <p>Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court.<br><br>I started tennis quite recently,and since then i am enjoying it a lot.I play in the tennis court in my condo making it very convenient, but due to the new rules in singapore i have to sadly stop tennis for a few weeks.But i do hope to play soon.</p>
